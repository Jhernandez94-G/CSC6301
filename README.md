About:
This repository contains two projects which organize integer values from least to greatest. The project smallestToGreatestLL specifically stores user-inputted values as a Linked List while the other project smallestToGreatestStack stores the values as a Stack. In this repository, you will also find javadocs explaining the aspects of each program.
